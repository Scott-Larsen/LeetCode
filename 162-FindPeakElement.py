# A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.

# Given an input array nums, where nums[i] ≠ nums[i+1], find a peak element and return its index.

# The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.

# You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞.

class Solution:
    def findPeakElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        return nums.index(max(nums))
